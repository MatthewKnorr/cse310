# Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to develop efficient and user-friendly applications that integrate various functionalities and technologies, including GUI development, database management, and data validation. This project focuses on creating an Employee Directory Management System using Python and Tkinter for the GUI and SQLite as the relational database.

The software provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing employee information. It allows users to add new employees, search for employees by last name, and navigate through the employee list using navigation buttons. The application also integrates with a SQL Relational Database to store and retrieve employee data, ensuring data persistence and scalability.

The purpose of developing this software is to enhance my skills in software development, particularly in building GUI applications and integrating them with relational databases. This project serves as a practical exercise to understand the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and data validation in a real-world application.

# Relational Database

I used SQLite as the relational database for this project due to its simplicity and ease of integration with Python. 

## Database Structure

The relational database consists of one table named `employees` with the following structure:

- `employee_id` (INTEGER): Unique identifier for each employee
- `first_name` (TEXT): First name of the employee
- `last_name` (TEXT): Last name of the employee
- `phone_number` (TEXT): Phone number of the employee
- `department` (TEXT): Department of the employee
- `date_of_joining` (TEXT): Date of joining of the employee

# Development Environment

- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Windows 10 x64**

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the development of the software
- **Tkinter**: Python library used for building the GUI
- **SQLite**: Relational
